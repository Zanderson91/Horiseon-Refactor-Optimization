The Horiseon website homepage has been modified to make the previous code more accessible.
Refactored HTML and CSS code will help to improve the site to be "semantically correct"


## Changes Made

-Non-Semantic code now follows semantic guidelines

-Page now follows a logical structure with better "flow"

-Images now contain alt attributes

-Heading attributes are in correct order and are sequential

-Title is now concise and descriptive

-CSS stylesheet is now less "redundant" 


## User Story
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
